SINGLETON

PROS
- Easy to debug
- Control of the singleton instance
- Easy to code

CONS
- Does not follow the single responsibility principle
- Singletons hide dependencies (when unit testing you should derive your singleton from an interface to allow dependency injections) 
- If not careful there could be possible race conditions
